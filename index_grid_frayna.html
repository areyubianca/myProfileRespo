	 		<p>hi it's been a while! Life during this pandemic is not easy, there are times that we cried, isolated ourselves from the people we love and we even judged our sense of living. It may be the hardest part of our lives. We lose love ones or some people cut their connections between us. The late night hangouts we missed, the bond we wished we had once again and the thought that we can't go out without fear and anxiaties. Regrets, doubts and the inevitable what ifs. These things our part of us but if you are going to ask me how I coped with these things simple I distracted myself with many things and allow me to share those. </p>

	 		 	<p> The lockdown turned me into a crazier person. Overthinkings are unstoppable but thanks to wattpad, I became okay. Unexpected persons and realationships have occured that did not last longer. It taught me lessons in life and some is one of my regrets. Healing is never easy but with the help of my favourite songs, I feel atleast at ease. Some songs who stayed with me during the days I am experiencing storms in my life, here are them:
	 		 	<i>this is home - cavetown</i><i>Fool - cavetown</i><i>Take her to the moon - Moira dela torre</i> <i>etc.</i>There are days that I feel like I am just barely living but then I discovered univeristy series, a series from wattpad. It once again opened up my "wattpader" side. Sometimes discovering something could be a great help for us. Reading and writing are the two things I have done the most of the time when I feel overthinking, crying or even happy. I believe that writing could help us to express our emotions. It can be also the best escape from the reality.</p>

	 			<p>Like the moon sometimes we are nowhere to be found, hidden behind the clouds. We often chase people who'll never look behind us and we'll end up stopping because we are already tired. Moons are attractive, so you are. So be brave, fight every battles that you'll go through and rest when you are tired. Like the moon you will meet the sun of your life and you will create one of the unique eclispe that happens once in your life. </p>
