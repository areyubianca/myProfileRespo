	 		 	<p> The lockdown turned me into a crazier person. Overthinkings are unstoppable but thanks to wattpad, I became okay. Unexpected persons and realationships have occured that did not last longer. It taught me lessons in life and some is one of my regrets. Healing is never easy but with the help of my favourite songs, I feel atleast at ease. Some songs who stayed with me during the days I am experiencing storms in my life, here are them:
	 		 	<i>this is home - cavetown</i><i>Fool - cavetown</i><i>Take her to the moon - Moira dela torre</i> <i>etc.</i>There are days that I feel like I am just barely living but then I discovered univeristy series, a series from wattpad. It once again opened up my "wattpader" side. Sometimes discovering something could be a great help for us. Reading and writing are the two things I have done the most of the time when I feel overthinking, crying or even happy. I believe that writing could help us to express our emotions. It can be also the best escape from the reality.</p>
