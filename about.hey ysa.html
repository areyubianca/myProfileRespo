	        <p>ITS ALL ABOUT YSA</p>
	     	<p>its your girl Bianca Ysabelle or a.k.a Ysa. a 14 year old 3rd year highschool. I want to be an architect and lawyer someday and these books from my faves inspires me to continue achieving my dreams. I am an ambitious teenager where every dream I dreamed of I believed that it would be real. Back in 2017 my friends influenced me to use the app and read some novels, at first I didn't got the hype from it then until 2019 came I was so addicted with the app. As far as I remembered the first teen-fiction that grabbed my attention is teen clash by idangs where four girls were transferees and there are four guys who are the kings inside the school. And after that books reading was already part of my hobbies.This website is more likely about me being a fangirl for my favourite authors and my favorite fictional characters. They said books bring you everywhere and here I am. There are a lot of things you can see and read here in my blog, enjoy!</p>
