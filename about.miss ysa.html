			   <p>Hello this is <b>Bianca Ysabelle D. Frayna.</b> I am Grade 9 Pythagoras student, a dreamer, writer and an achiever. For almost 10 months in school, I have learned many things especially in CSS and HTML. My main goal in life is to be atleast both Architect and Lawyer but if there will be a chance, I would like to be a pediatrician. I am a complicated person because there are times that I can convince myself that I am better but there are also times that I think that I am the worst person that have exsisted. </p>
			   <p>As you will view all of the websites that I have done for the previous grading, I felt that maybe there are some parts that I improved. Through viewing these website you can also notice the character development that I had. Making these websites are hard sometimes, there are times that I wanted to give up out of frustration but I wanted to achieve the "Atty./Arch./Dra.Bianca Ysabelle D. Frayna" And to achieve those, I have to accomplish these.</p>
			   <p>To make things short, I am an ambituous teenager with a thousand dreams in life. You will know me better as a student and a person itself if you will read all of my blogs that I have created and can be found in the <a href="portfolio.miss ysa.html">Portfolio</a>. Padayon, dreamers!</p>
