     <h2><i>The more you hate, the more you love.</i></h2>
       <p1>I finished reading Teen Clash by Idangs today and it's so amazing. Teen Clash was about four transferees who was bullied by the school's kings who was admired by kingdom high students. The story was kind a cilche but the writer wrote it in a simple way. My new favourite character, Ivan Charles Scott.</p1>
     <h2><i>We can fool the world but we cannot fool ourselves</i></h2>
        <p1>Until Trilogy by Jonaxx. This is a great masterpiece as in omg!! Elijah Montefalco is such an admirable fictional charcater. Montefalco Cousins are the best, especially when they were there when Klare needs them the most as in. Azreal Montefalco, aaaaa I love him huhu, he's the best, I remember him saying that one day he'd die for someone he love. The plot is so great!!</p1>
     <h2><i>Hindi lahat ng gusto mo, makukuha mo</i></h2>
        <p1>Love at first read, Kudos was more than enough but not for AB. This lovestory proves me that not all of us will have the happy ending that we deserve. Kudos deserves the world but he wanted so much to the point that he was asking for something he deserve but instead he was hurt. </p1>
     <h2><i>Not all mafias are bad, sometimes they are one of the best</i></h2>
        <p1>Zeke is a mafia boss but! but! but! he's the best, he met this girl named aemie. She's not that witted girl but she's one of   the dean lister in their university. There are silly things that aemie did and sometimes I got second hand embarrasment from. She's very funny and Zeke is a cold hearted man. My husband is a mafia boss is a masterpiece. AAAAAA PLOT TWISTS!! </p1>
     <h2><i>I'll get you out of here or I'd die trying</i></h2>
        <p1>Play the game is a law fiction where Juan Alexandro Yuchengo is a law student and the person that Katherine Arellano loves the most. Kitty followed Jax in the law school, HAHAHHA this story is kind of my inspiration in my lovelife and dreams in life like one day I want to follow my "inspiration" in law school since he'll be taking law and I have an interest to law, too! As expected Jax liked back Kitty but Jax was failling in law school and they have to break up. Kitty married another man but she was blamed that she killed he's husband. THE PLOT HERE WAS SO GREAT!! BECAUSE JAX REPRESENTED KITTY IN THE COURT!! HUHU PLOT TWISTS</p1>
     <h2><i>to my faves if you are reading this, thank you!</i></h2>
        <p1>Before this school year starts I am very ambitious teenager where because of some books on wattpad I dreamed of something that I didn't imagine that I will dream of. Back then before I started reading university series and game series my dreams are undefined then after I read it for some reasons I wanna be like them. To the point that I have already planned for the rest of my life, I know I was very young for that but it was so nice to think of things like that. I remember during our class, our teacher asked us about our dreams and I was very excited to tell mine. I remember telling there that "if kaya nila, syempre kakayanin ko din." The series gave me a path in life and I was thankful for that. Now I am making my way to achieve my dreams, one of them is to be a lawyer. I was really thankful because I have read that series. Jax Yuchengco, thank you. I went and aim this high. And to that special person, thank you for being a great inspiration. </p1>
