      <p1>Wattpad created a big impact in my life. Back when I was younger, I have never had interest 
      in reading novels because it's cliche and I more on fantisies. It changed not only my life but also how 
      I see life myself. Form the characters that thought a lot and improved my personality to the authors
      who I am attached with. As a not so perfect living teen here, they made my life full of rainbows and
      unicorns from black and white. Reading wattpad is not just about the novels but also the app gave me another
      will to live. I met strangers who little did I know will play big role in my life, strangers who taught me a lot
      of things that I have never learned from school and from my parents. I never aimed these high in my life.
      In wattpad we don't all read and imagine but also we dream and aim things that are from possible.</p1>
